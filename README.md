# DUMMY HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM

## Introduction

This project is purely for learning purposes, as a capstone project of a Python Design Principles course.

## Description

Some concepts applied were:
- 3 layered architecture:
1. "routers" layer: top layer, with all API and Web related stuff.
2. "operations" layer: mid layer, for data and process mapping.
3. "db": bottom layer, for ORM and service interaction.

- Interface and protocol for decoupling.

- Dependency Injection

- Patch everything on top level layer
